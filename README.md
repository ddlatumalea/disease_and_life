# Analysis of Chronic Disease and Life Expectancy

**Research question**: Do chronic diseases influence the life expectancy?

**H<sub>0</sub>**: Chronic diseases do not significantly influence the life expectancy.

**H<sub>1</sub>**: Chronic diseases do significantly influence the life expectancy.

-------
When plotting the data in a graph, diseases should so a negative correlation with life expectancy:

## Assumptions
At the moment, chronic diseases are responsible
for 71% of all deaths<sup>a</sup>. Thus, we assume chronic diseases have a very big impact on the life expectancy.

## Definitions
***Chronic disease***: a condition that, "tend to be of long duration and is the result of a
combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors<sup>a</sup>, for instance<sup>a,b,c</sup>:
<ul>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Chronic respiratory diseases</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Alzheimer's disease</li>
</ul>

***Life expectancy***: the number of years a person can expect to live. 
This can be calculated in several ways. Most studies use the 'period life expectancy'. It is an estimation of the average length of life
for a hypothetical cohort living through the age-specific mortality at one period in time. This means, the value can
deviate from the actual 'cohort life expectancy', which is the average life length of a particular cohort <sup>d</sup>.
The calculation can be based on the year of birth, death rates, current age, and demographic factors such as sex<sup>e</sup>.    

There are other definitions, but they will not be used in this project. If you'd like to know more, you can always contact me at d.d.latumalea@hst.hanze.nl

## SOLID
### Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should have, and only one reason to change.
- A class can have multiple methods as long as they correspond to the same logic.

### Open Close Principle
- Be able to extend a classes behaviour, without modifying it.

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle
- Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
- Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
